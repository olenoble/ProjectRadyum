; Note that doors can be opened by unlocking a room or by using a code
; Assume no more that 4 doors per room

; Notes on the mapping file. For each room:
; 1) store  map start (20x10)
; 2) map target (20x10)  --> since edges are not used to compare, the door position should hold an action number
; --> 20x10x2 = 400 bytes per room (up to 65535 / 400) - over 160 rooms in one segment - 128 max should be enough!!!! (51kb)

; Info/text/passcode (separate file ??). For each room:
; 0) byte info --> e.g. changeable room, password generation, etc... - 1 byte
; 1) passcode to be generated (if relevant) - letter + 2 digits - 3bytes
; 2) passcode position (xy) 1 byte  
; 2) text to display (bottom-right corner - 40x160 - maybe use 8x8 borders --> 25 * 3; using 8x8 characters = 75 bytes)
; 3) a list of action number information:
;           a) the room it leads to (1 byte) + higher bit should say whether room is unlocked by solving the room or...
;           b) passcode to unclock - 3bytes
;           c) passcode requested (upon question, e.g. 3x2 / 1x3 / 1x1)        (2 bytes)

; --> 80 bytes per room (10kb for 128 rooms)
; --> 6 bytes per action number. If 2 actions in average per room, then 1.5kb for 128 room
; Need to store in the code the list of solved rooms

; when leaving the game, screens can be saved (with current position and all cleared rooms +passwords)
; use a basic batch files that allows user to switch - will simply copy / erase files and replace with 


;;;;; SPEED DRAWING SPRITES + BACKGROUND
; max speed (no redraw of background)
; 10s for 10 laps - each lap is 70 screen refresh
; 1s per lap --> 70 frames per second

; meta tile and up to 4
; 10s for 10 laps - each lap is 70 screen refresh
; 1s per lap --> 70 frames per second

; 4 and up to 64 meta tiles !!!
; still 20s for 10 laps - each lap is 70 screen refresh
; 2s per lap --> 35 frames per second

; with screen display fast
; 20s for 10 laps - each lap is 70 screen refresh
; 2s per lap --> 35 frames per second

; non fast
; 30s for 10 laps (70 frames per lap)
; 3s per lap --> 23 frames per second
