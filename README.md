# ProjectRadyum

TO DO (REQUIRED)<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Music (looks like library works but might be an issue of memory mgmt, especially with small files - also need to speed up the code with music - use trick to only redraw area around character unless change in screen)<br>
<li>Add nice feature for the last room (better middle square.. possibility to walk on it - fade to white, etc... showing closed doors)<br>
<li>Improve collision detection (check entire side)<br>
<li>When releasing code - remove all c:\ (only useful for TD)<br>
<li>Add proper credits at the end (instead of thank you for...) - that includes path to gift / blog<br>
<li>Move room data to file with option to save upon leaving<br>
</ol>
