TO DO<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Why is there no fade in when getting in the first room ??<br>
<li>While switching rooms, only fadein/fadeout the play area<br>
<li>Instead of refreshing the whole screen - only refresh the 32*32 area around (should be able to nearly double frame by second)<br>
<li>Boundary detection - should probably detect a whole side and not just a middle point<br>
<li>Need to rethink the keyboard management (poorly reactive) - maybe read keyboard on a timed basis ? or use a system with a single entry buffer but that checks when the last pressed key is no longer pressed ? <br>
<li>When releasing code - remove all c:\ (only useful for TD)<br>
</ol>
