TO DO<br><br>

1. To add a blank character and _ <br>
2. Why is there no fade in when getting in the first room ??<br>
3. While switching rooms, only fadein/fadeout the play area<br>
4. instead of refreshing the whole screen - only refresh the 32*32 area around (should be able to nearly double frame by second)<br>
5. boundary detection - should probably detect a whole side and not just a middle point<br>
6. Need to rethink the keyboard management (poorly reactive) - maybe read keyboard on a timed basis ? or use a system with a single entry buffer but that checks when the last pressed key is no longer pressed ? <br>
15. When releasing code - remove all c:\ (only useful for TD)<br>
