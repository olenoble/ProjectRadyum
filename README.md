# ProjectRadyum

TO DO (REQUIRED)<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Music (looks like library works but might be an issue of memory mgmt, especially with small files - also need to speed up the code with music - use trick to only redraw area around character unless change in screen)<br>
<li>Generate all rooms - add special characters into tileset<br>
<li>Improve collision detection (check entire side)<br>
<li>When releasing code - remove all c:\ (only useful for TD)<br>
<li>Add proper credits at the end (instead of thank you for...) - that includes path to gift / blog<br>
<li>Move room data to file with option to save upon leaving<br>
</ol>

<br><br>
TO DO (If enough time)<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Find a way to reset color palette after a cycle (otherwise colors look crap) 
<li>Change loading screen to use the tiles instead ??<br>
<li>Need to rethink the keyboard management (poorly reactive) - maybe read keyboard on a timed basis ? or use a system with a single entry buffer but that checks when the last pressed key is no longer pressed ? <br>
</ol>
