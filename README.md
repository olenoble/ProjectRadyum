TO DO<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Password management<br>
<li>Music
<li>Generate all rooms - ajoute des caracteres speciaux pour la tileset<br>
<li>Change loading screen to use the tiles instead ??<br>
<li>Need to rethink the keyboard management (poorly reactive) - maybe read keyboard on a timed basis ? or use a system with a single entry buffer but that checks when the last pressed key is no longer pressed ? <br>
<li>When releasing code - remove all c:\ (only useful for TD)<br>
<li>Add proper credits at the end (instead of thank you for...) - that includes path to gift / blog<br>
</ol>
