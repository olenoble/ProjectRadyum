TO DO<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Write Done in the clue area once completed<br>
<li>Need to rethink the keyboard management (poorly reactive) - maybe read keyboard on a timed basis ? or use a system with a single entry buffer but that checks when the last pressed key is no longer pressed ? <br>
<li>When releasing code - remove all c:\ (only useful for TD)<br>
</ol>
